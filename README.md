# Horror Demo
A Neurotech demo that synchronizes restfulness and mindfulness metrics extracted from frontal lobe EEG
with envrionmental game input.

Fuse multiple neural data inputs such as facial metrics, heart rate and EEG.
Use the fused results to make fear predictions using a custom model.
    Wont train this model but based on hyperparameter tuning that weights each input metric differently

Game logic code will be in Godot
The demo will require muse headsets with HR functionality
